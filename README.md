## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 5.0

### What I learned

I am at first feeling lost on how to do it. I am trying to maximize code from Bootstrap as my company practices. But I also lost how to do it. Only know this is using card.

Here I still have a lot of weakness, anyone can help to how to make the width of equilibrium image to be same width and height? also how to adjust the justify-items-center of icon?


### Continued development

To be honest I am looking at what others did, and copy and try. If I start do from scratch I might fail.

### Useful resources

- [:root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) - This helped me for standardize the color, and copy what others do and try to reason why they use this
- [Box Sizing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_box-sizing.asp) - This help me to understand margin calculation.
- [Border Radius](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp) - here use a lot of border and border radius
- [Justify Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content)
